Section 1: User Story

Epic Story
As a Notice Processing Officer who needs to follow up against notices in the OCMS, I want the OCMS to allow me to change the processing stage of a notice, so that the OCMS can revert to an earlier processing stage to resend reminders or escalate to speed up the processing of a notice.

The Change Processing Stage module allows OICs to manually change a notice's processing stage, which in turn changes its workflow.

The OCMS Staff Portal has a Change Notice Processing Stage module that allows OCMS OICs to:

Search for notice(s) to be updated with a new processing stage.

Display the search results which are applicable to change the new processing stage on screen.

Change the new processing stage by selecting the notice and completing the new processing stage form.

Perform a validity check for the new processing stage is allowed to change before sending the change request to the OCMS backend.

Retrieve and download the Change Notice Processing Stage Data Report from the backend to view the Notices that manually change the new processing stage.

When the Change Processing Stage is initiated from the Portal, the OCMS Backend will:

Section 3 – Manual Stage Change Initiated by PLUS

3.1 Use case

1. The Change Processing Stage refers to the scenario where PLUS triggers a request to OCMS to manually change a notice's processing stage, which in turn changes its workflow.

2. This occurs when PLUS officers need to change the current processing stage of a notice, and the change is carried out manually within the notice processing workflow.

3. The PLUS system will perform validation to decide whether a Notice is eligible for a  before the request is sent to the OCMS Intranet Backend.

4. When the OCMS Intranet Backend receives a stage change request, it performs the following actions for change processing stage submission:

Validate the request and update the next_processing_stage of the notice in the VON table..

Generate the report for internal tracking.

Return the notice details (with the updated next_processing_stage) together with the report link to the OCMS Staff Portal

Note : 
Since PLUS is not allowed to change the stage to CFC, option should not be displayed in the dropdown list of New Processing Stage.
